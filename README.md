FastAPI Inventory Management (MCP Enabled)

A robust, modular CRUD API built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. This service is designed with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, allowing it to serve as a toolset for AI agents (like Claude or Cursor) to interact directly with your database.

Architecture

Framework: FastAPI (Asynchronous-ready)
ORM: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (local development)
AI Integration: FastAPI-MCP for agentic tool discovery
Structure: Modular design with separation of concerns between database models, Pydantic schemas, and API logic.
